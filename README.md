# Predicting the Type of Cancer from Gene Expression
This repository is an academic project done as part of the course `CS 584` **Theory and Applications of Data Mining** from *George Mason University (GMU)*.

The dataset is taken from [UCI's ML Repo](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/gene+expression+cancer+RNA-Seq). It contains gene-expression levels of various genes (represented as attributes). Each row is a sequence of RNA-Seq gene expression levels measured by *Illumina HiSeq* platform of a patient. Each patient is associated with one of the 5 types of cancers given by:
* BRCA (Breast Invasive Carcinoma )
* KIRC (Kidney Renal Clear Cell Carcinoma)
* COAD (Colon Adenocarcinoma)
* LUAD (Lung Adenocarcinoma)
* PRAD (Prostate Adenocarcinoma)

The code is given in the `Project.ipynb` file. I carried out various modeling techniques to classify the gene expressions into the 5 types of cancer.
